# TreasureHunt
📖 Project Overview  This is a 2D Treasure Hunt game developed in Java (Swing). The player moves around a tiled map, collects keys, and interacts with different game objects. Currently, the game has basic functionality implemented, including player movement, object rendering, and sound effects.

✅ Features Completed So Far.

🎮 Player movement system (keyboard-controlled).
🖼️ Sprite animations for player movement (up, down, left, right).
🔑 Objects like keys placed on the map.
🔊 Sound effects integrated for actions (e.g., collecting items).
🗺️ Tile-based map rendering using a custom TileManager.
⚡ Collision detection system between player and objects.

🚀 Future Improvements / Tasks

🏆 Winning condition (e.g., collect all keys or reach a treasure chest).
👾 Add enemies with movement patterns and collisions.
🛡️ Add obstacles (walls, locked doors, traps).
🌍 Expand the map with multiple levels / bigger areas.
💾 Save/Load game state (store progress in a file or database).
🎨 Better graphics (animated objects, background effects).
🧠 AI enhancements (e.g., smart enemies that chase the player).
📈 High-score system to track best players.
🕹️ Menu system (start screen, pause, game over).
